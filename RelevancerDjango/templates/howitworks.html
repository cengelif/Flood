			<h3>Retweet Elimination</h3><br>
			<p>
			Any tweet that has an indication of being a retweet in the respective field of
			the tweet JSON file, which is returned by Twitter API for a particular tweet,
			or has the “rt @” string in the lower cased version of the tweet text is treated
			as a retweet and eliminated.
			</p>

			<h3>Features</h3><br>
			<p>
			Anything that occurs in a tweet text is used as a feature in the machine learning
			algorithms. Tokens are separated based on the punctuation and space charac-
			ters. Features can be: Hahstags, single letters, numbers, any token that consist
			of letter and number combinations, and emoticons. Moreover, we preserve case
			of the text.
			The aim in using all aforementioned features is to be able capture any nuance
			that may present in groups of tweets. As a result, we can detect and handle
			many stylistic and textual characteristics properly.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Near Duplicate Tweet Elimination</h3><br>
			<p>
			Near duplicate tweets occur due to implicit retweeting, sharing the same news
			article and quote among others. Since the focus is not identifying those groups
			as one group of tweets most of the time and they may restrict ability of the basic
			algorithms to identify group of related tweets, we eliminate the near duplicate
			tweet groups. We leave one tweet from this near-duplicate group in the data
			set. Having a smaller data set at the end, create space for the clustering step
			to be quick and yield coherent results.
			If the cosine similarity bigger than 0.8, we assume those tweets as duplicates.
			In case the memory does not allow to process all tweets, we perform the following
			steps. First we split the data in buckets of tweets in the size that can be handled
			quickly and find and eliminate duplicates in each bucket. After that we combine
			and shuffle the remaining tweets, which are unique in their respective bucket.
			We repeat that steps until we can not find any duplicate in any bucket.
			</p>

			<h3>Adaptive Clustering</h3><br>
			<p>
			The clustering step aims to identify clusters of tweets that contains related
			tweets. Finding coherent clusters is not easy with a basic algorithm like K-
			Means for a big and rich data set. Therefore, we search for good clusters in
			an adaptive manner. In case the data bigger than a certain number of tweets,
			which depends on the availability of the memory, we apply MiniBatch K-means.
			Otherwise, we apply regular KMeans. Parameters of the K-Means are assigned
			based on the dynamics of the dataset and required number of clusters.
			The clusters are evaluated based on how close the tweets are to the center
			of the clusters. A good cluster should contain tweets that are close to the
			center of the cluster. The closest and the most distant tweets should be close
			enough to the cluster center and the distance between them should not exceed a
			certain threshold. Moreover In case an iteration is not resulted with number of
			required number of clusters, the same method is called recursively by relaxing
			the threshold parameters based on the proportion of the required clusters and
			found clusters. Tweets that are in the already selected clusters are preserved as
			they are and do not included in the next clustering iteration. In case the cluster
			selection parameters reach to unacceptable threshold values, the clustering will
			not do any other iteration.
